Isometric-Tile-Game-Demo
========================

This was a school assignment.

The game consist finding the way out of a maze in less than 1 min (is sufficient time for a tiny maze). It was made in ActionScript using FlashBuilder 4.0 as IDE for Flash 11 as target platform version.

I used my own game engine. You can obtained [here](https://github.com/Xertz/MyFirstEngine).
